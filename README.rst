algs: An AutoML System for Algorithm Selection
==============================================

**algs** is an AutoML system for **Alg**\orithm **S**\election. In machine learning
and data ming, algorithm selection refers to find the best performing algorithm
for each individual instance, e.g., an arbitrary dataset.

As shown on automl.org, the full system may look like below:

To make algorithm selection easy, **algs** is introduced with a bunch of popular selection
algorithms in the field.
